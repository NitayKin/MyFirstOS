QUestions:

1. max 50 sectors can be pasted to memory - why?
2. why i need so many sectors for variables?
3. interrupt 0x08 clock only working once.


Answer:
1.  ?
2.  we load our kernel in 0x1000.
    remember! the 0x200 first bytes are THE BOOT SECTOR, therefor every reference to memory should be 0x200-0x1000 (-0xe00) where it should be.
    in code we see that the memory is 0x4000 = WHICH MEANS IT IS 0X3200 IN THE OS IMAGE.
    only relevant to not run-time initialized variables!
3.  need to add to function decleration __attribute__(interrupt) ( bcs in interrupt we push all registers, and also with iret not normal ret).
    in adition, need to end with epiloge :
    __asm__ volatile ("in al, 0x60"); //read information from the device
    __asm__ volatile ("mov al, 0x20");
    __asm__ volatile ("out 0x20, al"); //tell the PIC its over
